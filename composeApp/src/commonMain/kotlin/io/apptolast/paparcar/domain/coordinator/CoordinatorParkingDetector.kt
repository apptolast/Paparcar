/**
 * Orchestrates the parking-detection loop for a single driving session.
 *
 * Call [invoke] with a location [Flow] to start detection. The use case
 * internally aggregates sensor signals, delegates scoring to
 * [CalculateParkingConfidenceUseCase], and delegates persistence + geofence
 * + notification to [ConfirmParkingUseCase] once confidence is high enough
 * or the user confirms manually.
 *
 * External state updates (vehicle exit, user confirmation) are fed in via
 * [onVehicleExit], [onUserConfirmedParking], and [onUserDeniedParking].
 *
 * **Confirmation paths and reliability:**
 * 1. User taps "Sí" → immediate, [ParkingDetectionConfig.reliabilityUserConfirmed] (1.0).
 * 2. IN_VEHICLE→EXIT observed + [ParkingDetectionConfig.vehicleExitObservationWindowMs]
 *    elapsed without the vehicle driving away → [ParkingDetectionConfig.reliabilityVehicleExit] (~0.90).
 * 3. Step proof (`stepCount ≥ minStepsToConfirm`) inside CANDIDATE phase →
 *    [ParkingDetectionConfig.reliabilityVehicleExit] (steps are unambiguous user-out-of-car).
 * 4. **EXIT + steps fast confirm** (post-CANDIDATE bypass): `vehicleExitConfirmed = true`
 *    AND `stepCount ≥ minStepsToConfirm` BEFORE the scoring path reaches High →
 *    [ParkingDetectionConfig.reliabilityVehicleExit]. Skips the slow-path 5-min stop
 *    requirement entirely. [BUG-OPPO-LATE-CONFIRM][DET-D-03]
 *
 * **Prompt invariant.** A notification is shown when [ParkingConfidence.High] is first reached
 * via paths 2/3, so the user can override the auto-confirmation. Path 4 skips the prompt and
 * goes straight to the post-save "Vehículo aparcado · Cancelar" card; the REVERT button on
 * that card carries the same override affordance.
 *
 * **Path precedence inside the collect block** (BUG-COORD-115 invariant):
 *   1. `falseEnterAbortSteps` reached pre-drive → abort spurious session. [BUG-FALSE-ENTER-WALKING]
 *   2. `maxNoMovementMs` elapsed pre-drive → abort spurious session.
 *   3. Lock `activeVehicleId` on first driving-speed fix.
 *   4. `userConfirmedParking` short-circuits everything.
 *   5. `!hasEverReachedDrivingSpeed` skip (waiting for the driving signal).
 *   6. Response-timeout abort.
 *   7. Candidate-phase decision tree.
 *   8. EXIT + steps fast confirm (post-CANDIDATE bypass). [BUG-OPPO-LATE-CONFIRM]
 *   9. Confidence evaluation (advances [ConfirmationPhase]).
 * This ordering guarantees that a user tap always wins over an auto-confirm that landed in
 * the same iteration, eliminating any double-save risk by construction. The pre-drive aborts
 * at the top let a spurious AR ENTER end the session before any side-effect runs.
 *
 * **Lifecycle:** Stateful Koin `single`. State is fully reset on entry to [invoke] AND
 * on exit (finally), so the same instance can be reused across multiple driving
 * sessions without leaking data from a previous run. [FIX BUG-SERVICE-109]
 *
 * **Thread-safety:** All mutable state is held in a single [MutableStateFlow]
 * of [ParkingDetectionState] and updated atomically via [MutableStateFlow.update].
 * External signals ([onVehicleExit] etc.) may be called from any thread.
